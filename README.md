# CSS

The `css` directory contains 2 stylesheets and a minified version of each.
Do not edit these by hand - they are compiled from the equivalently named
files in the `scss` folder.

## Usage
* `css/styles.css(.min)` includes all of Bootstrap4
* `css/shiny.css(.min)` is a small set of styles designed for use in
`RShiny` apps where Bootstrap3 is already present

## Compiling the scss
1. Run `npm install`
1. Make edits to `style.scss` or `shiny.scss`
1. Run `gulp styles` to compile both of the above

# Logos

Logos can be found in the `images` folder.

# HTML

This repo includes a simple `html` template including a header and
footer styled with our logo and colours: https://github.com/reside-ic/logo/blob/master/index.html
